Here
are some phrases I’d be cool with never encountering again. “Shuts down.”
“Destroys.” “Drags.” “Eviscerates.” So much yelling out there. So. Much.
Booing. Aren’t you tired of fights and insults, too? If you are, then no doubt
you too took in Michelle Obama’s Monday night speech at the Democratic National
Convention as a healing balm on a nation suffering from wide-scale sick burns.

In a speech that was to political rhetoric what Beyoncé is to everything else, the First Lady eloquently
expressed her endorsement for “our friend Hillary Clinton” and laid out the
legacy of her husband’s administration. Along the way, she also articulated
what it means to do the tough work of being the bigger person.

She said it, quite clearly, to the Trump supporters, and she said it to the
Bernie-or-Busters. She revealed that she has to urge her daughters “to ignore
those who question their father’s citizenship or faith.” She talked about Mrs.
Clinton, noting how “When she didn’t win the nomination eight years ago, she
didn’t get angry or disillusioned…. There were plenty of moments when Hillary
could have decided that this work was too hard, that the price of public
service was too high, that she was tired of being picked apart for how she
looks or how she talks or even how she laughs. But here’s the thing. What I
admire most about Hillary is that she never buckles under pressure.”

And most pointedly, in a message that ought to be familiar to anyone who’s ever
been or had a loving parent, she spoke of how she and Barack tell their
daughters, “When someone is cruel or acts like a bully, you don’t stoop to
their level. No, our motto is, when they go
low, we go high.”

The high road often feels like the world’s roughest and least well-trafficked one.
It also, it must be said, often feels like one that women and minorities are
expected to travel far more than others. Watching Mrs. Obama Monday night, I
was reminded of Jesse Williams’ BET Humanitarian Award speech last month, when
he pointed out that “The burden of the brutalized is not to comfort the bystander. That’s not
our job.” But what Michelle Obama was speaking to was the difficult,
important, invisible work of not escalating the fear and divisiveness, of not
becoming the things we despise. And you don’t have to be running for President
of the United States of America to take that message to heart.
