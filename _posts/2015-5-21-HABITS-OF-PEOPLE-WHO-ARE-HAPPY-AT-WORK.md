<p style="margin-left:0in;background:white;">
	When it comes to the research results on happiness in the
American workforce, the statistics are not flattering.
</p>
<p style="margin-left:0in;background:white;">
	A recent survey by the
staffing firm Manpower Group discovered that nearly two-thirds of American and
Canadian workers were not happy in their job. A recent Gallup survey found that
close to 60% of American workers were unhappy enough in their jobs to want a
new career. Most of us have found ourselves in a job that was not fulfilling at
some point.
</p>
<p style="margin-left:0in;background:white;">
	While psychologists and
social scientists believe some of our happiness is predetermined by our genes,
at least a major portion of it is within our control.
</p>
<p style="margin-left:0in;background:white;">
	Regardless of your
situation at work, here are seven habits that people who have found happiness
at their jobs have mastered.
</p>
<h4 style="background:white;">
	1.
THEY HAVE COMMITTED TO CONTINUOUSLY IMPROVING AS A LIFETIME GOAL.
</h4>
<p style="margin-left:0in;background:white;">
	Happier people believe in
doing the best they can whether or not they are given credit for the work they
do. Giving their best makes them feel better about themselves. It creates
character, builds self-regard, and forms good work habits that will benefit them
in the future regardless if anyone in their present position notices or cares.
</p>

<h4 style="background:white;">
	2.
THEY HAVE GOALS WORTH STRIVING FOR.
</h4>
<p style="margin-left:0in;background:white;">
	People with clear goals
they are working toward are able to look beyond everyday workplace irritants
and problems. They know they will be temporary, and are able to see beyond
them. When things are not going well, they focus on their goals instead of the
negative situation that surrounds them at work.
</p>
<h4 style="background:white;">
	3.
THEY DON’T GET CAUGHT UP IN ISSUES BEYOND THEIR CONTROL.
</h4>
<p style="margin-left:0in;background:white;">
	Happier people don’t let themselves
get emotionally caught up in negative vibes or gossip that is toxic in the
workplace. They focus on the work at hand and on what they are able to do. They
avoid getting involved in issues and conflicts that do not involve them and are
beyond their area of involvement. They always focus their attention and
energies on areas they have control over, which gives them a sense of
satisfaction,
</p>
<h4 style="background:white;">
	4.
THEY ARE WILLING TO HELP OTHERS.
</h4>
<p style="margin-left:0in;background:white;">
	Happy people are always
looking for ways they can help others. Researchers at the University of
Wisconsin-Madison found that people who helped others at work were happier than
those who didn’t. While helping others can lead to promotion, there are also
warm feelings of satisfaction that come from helping out our fellow human beings.
</p>
<h4 style="background:white;">
	5.
THEY AVOID NEGATIVE PEOPLE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.
</h4>
<p style="margin-left:0in;background:white;">
	When coming across a
negative person or chronic complainer at work, happy people find ways to try to
refocus on coming up with solutions or looking at the situation from another
angle.
</p>
<p style="margin-left:0in;background:white;">
	Their positive energy often
causes complainers and whiners to avoid them since they know they will not
receive a sympathetic ear. Happy people are aware that negative people are an
energy drain, and find ways to limit the amount of time that they have to spend
with them.
</p>
<h4 style="background:white;">
	6.
THEY MAKE GRATITUDE AN INTEGRAL PART OF THEIR LIFE.
</h4>
<p style="margin-left:0in;background:white;">
	While they strive for more
in life, happy people are constantly aware of all the reasons they have to be
grateful. They express their gratitude freely and openly, and are quick to
offer thanks to those who help them or do a kind deed. This attitude of
gratitude attracts people to the positive energy that they give off. Colleagues
want to be around them and work with them. When things are not going well, they
choose to focus on all of the things that have gone well in their lives.
</p>
<h4 style="background:white;">
	7.
THEY MANAGE THEIR EMOTIONS AND HAVE A SENSE OF HUMOR.
</h4>
<p style="margin-left:0in;background:white;">
	Happy people automatically
try to make the most of every situation, whether at work, home, or play. They
have discovered they can change their emotions by smiling or thinking of
humorous situations. They are also able to distract themselves by thinking of
pleasant, happy, fun times and places.
</p>
<p style="margin-left:0in;background:white;">
	Whenever a situation comes
up that threatens to engulf them in negative energy, they rely on their ability
to rise above it and remain in a positive mental space.
