<p>
	<span style="line-height:1.5;">I often write about how a good start to your day often
leads to having a good day in general.</span>
</p>
<p>
	A social, an energetic or a
productive start sets the context for your day.
</p>
<p>
	But on some days you may not get a
good start for some reason.
</p>
<p>
	Maybe you slept badly. Or the maybe
grey skies and cold spring rain is dragging your energy down.
</p>
<p>
	Or you might have lost that positive
momentum during a hard first part of the day and after lunch you feel tired,
low or lost in a somewhat sad or uninspired funk.
</p>
<p>
	What to do then? Is that day lost and
should you just aim for a better day tomorrow?
</p>
<p>
	Well, today is not over yet.
</p>
<p>
	Maybe you can still make something
good out it.
</p>
<p>
	Here’s how I do that by breaking the
negative mood and getting a new start.
</p>

<p>
	1. Appreciate what you have.
</p>
<p>
	The simplest of my most commonly used
pick-me-ups.
</p>
<p>
	I take about 2 minutes and sit in
silence.
</p>
<p>
	I tell myself: OK, I might not feel
so good right now, but what can I be grateful for and appreciate in my life?
</p>
<p>
	I usually come up with one simple
thing like:
</p>
<p>
	§&nbsp; My
tasty food.
</p>
<p>
	§&nbsp; My
health.
</p>
<p>
	§&nbsp; That
I have a roof.
</p>
<p>
	That one thing opens up my mind. It
redirects my thoughts from the negativity.
</p>
<p>
	Then I build upon that one thing. I
make mental jumps from the roof, to the warmth in our home, to the fluffy cat
sitting beside me on the sofa, to that I can work from home as the rain pours
outside.
</p>
<p>
	I make those small mental leaps by
just moving my attention around in the room I am in. Like skipping from stone
to stone over a stream. And I take the time to slowly appreciate all those
things.
</p>
<p>
	This changes my mood to&nbsp;<a href="http://premium.positivityblog.com/optimism-course/">a happier, warmer and more open one</a>.
</p>
<p>
	2. Act as you would like to feel.
</p>
<p>
	Emotions work backwards too. So if I
want to become more positive or enthusiastic then I act in the manner of a
person who is positive or enthusiastic.
</p>
<p>
	I might not feel like it. But I do it
as best as I can anyway. I may for example:
</p>
<p>
	§&nbsp; Think
of the task I have in front of me as something exciting and fun.
</p>
<p>
	§&nbsp; Answer
some emails or talk to someone in a positive and enthusiastic manner.
</p>
<p>
	§&nbsp; Assume
rapport if I feel unmotivated, negative or nervous before some kind of meeting
(assuming rapport is to I think to myself that I am meeting one of my best
friends just before the meeting and that puts me in the right mood and
headspace).
</p>
<p>
	3. Think for a minute and give someone a genuine
compliment.
</p>
<p>
	Here’s a fun one I use quite often
and that will not only lift my own mood.
</p>
<p>
	Spend one minute coming up with
something you really and genuinely appreciate about someone in your life that
is in the same room as you at some point during the day. Then tell him or her
the genuine compliment you have come up with.
</p>
<p>
	She or he will be happy.&nbsp;<a href="http://premium.positivityblog.com/self-esteem-course/">You’ll feel good about yourself</a>&nbsp;and get
positive feelings too from the now smiling, happy and complimented person. And
so the mood for the both of you is changed for the better.
