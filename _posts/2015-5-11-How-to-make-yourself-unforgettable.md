<p style="margin-left:0in;background:white;">
	Deep down, we all just want to be
remembered.
</p>
<p style="margin-left:0in;background:white;">
	In
today’s distraction-filled world, it’s easier said than done. The average adult
has 360 messages coming at them each day via TV, radio, Internet, newspapers,
and magazines, according to a study by<span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>Media Dynamics. Less than half are noted and far
fewer make enough of an impact to be recalled.
</p>
<p style="margin-left:0in;background:white;">
	If
you’re trying to stand out in the midst of that chaos, you’ve got your work cut
out for you.
</p>
<p style="margin-left:0in;background:white;">
	"In
the 1980s and 1990s, advertisers needed to be in front of prospects six to
eight times to become recognizable, says Bill Corbett, Jr., president of<span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>Corbett Public Relations. "Today
this number is closer to 21 and may even be higher."
</p>
<p style="margin-left:0in;background:white;">
	Instead
of introducing yourself a couple dozen times (and running the risk of being
annoying), here are some things you can do to get noticed and be remembered.
</p>

<h4 style="background:white;">
	ACTIONS

<p style="margin-left:0in;background:white;">
	<span class="subhead"><b>Wear A "Signature" Item</b></span><br />
Sometimes becoming memorable is simply paying attention to what you wear. Steve
Jobs was known for his black mock turtleneck and jeans, and Nancy A. Shenker,
CEO of<span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>theONswitch marketing
firm, says memorable people dress like their brand.
</p>
<p style="margin-left:0in;background:white;">
	"I often wear brightly
patterned dresses and hoop earrings," she says. "Some men always wear
a bow tie or cuff links. Even if people don't remember your name, they'll
remember ‘the guy who always wears a hat.’"<span class="MsoHyperlink"></span> 
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="background:white;">
	IF
YOU CAN’T BE BRILLIANT, HE SAID, AT LEAST BE MEMORABLE.<span class="MsoHyperlink"></span> 
</p>
<p style="margin-left:0in;background:white;">
	David Ogilvy, founder of<span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>Ogilvy &amp;
Mather<span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>ad agency, wore
kilts to work. "If you can’t be brilliant, he said, at least be
memorable," Ogilvy &amp; Mather chairman emeritusShelly Lazarus<span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>recalled in an interview with<span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><em>Harvard Business Review</em>.
"Trust me: If you met David, you remembered."<span class="MsoHyperlink"></span> 
</p>
<p style="margin-left:0in;background:white;">
	<span class="subhead"><b>Take The Lead</b></span><span class="subhead"><br />
It’s hard to remember 100 names of people in a room, but the leader who runs
the meeting and is the focus of attention instantly becomes memorable, says
Corbett. "When you are a leader, you command respect, and the attention of
people in a room or organization," he says. "Successful leaders who
empower others are even more memorable."<br />
<br />
</span><span class="subhead"><b>Make a Difference</b></span><span class="subhead"><br />
Forget about meeting expectations, trying your hardest, and staying at work the
latest, says</span><span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><span class="subhead">David Sturt</span><span class="subhead">,
vice president of the</span><span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><span class="subhead">O.C. Tanner Institute,
an employee recognition consulting firm. Memorable people go deeper than that.</span><span class="MsoHyperlink"></span> 
</p>
<p style="margin-left:0in;background:white;">
	"Not
only do your job, but create a difference—different than the expected,
different than the assumed, and different than the last time," he says. "That's
how you become memorable and your work gets recognized and noticed."<span class="MsoHyperlink"></span> 
</p>
<p style="margin-left:0in;background:white;">
	<span class="subhead"><b>Follow Up</b></span><span class="subhead"><br />
Don’t let people forget you, says Sheila Benko, career counselor and associate
director of partnerships at UCLA: "Always follow up!" she says. In
business settings, after a meeting, you should always reach out to share a tip,
article, resource, or even a simple thank you," she says.</span><span class="MsoHyperlink"></span> 
</p>
<p style="margin-left:0in;background:white;">
	Jason
Abrams, a Michigan-based realtor who specializes in selling homes
to professional athletes, says his success came through two memorable thank yous.
After making his first athlete sale to a Detroit Lions football player, he flew
to North Carolina and California to personally thank the player’s financial
adviser and agent.<span class="MsoHyperlink"></span> 
</p>
<p style="margin-left:0in;background:white;">
	Both
men were impressed that Abrams flew out to personally deliver his thanks, and
he was rewarded with several more referrals, and later landed a series on HGTV
about his business called<span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><em>Scoring
the Deal</em>.<span class="MsoHyperlink"></span> 
</p>
<h4 style="background:white;">
	WORDS<span class="MsoHyperlink"></span> 
</h4>
<p style="margin-left:0in;background:white;">
	<span class="subhead"><b>Really Listen</b></span><span class="subhead"><br />
To be interesting, be interested, says Benko. "People like to talk about
their interests, so give them a chance to do so," she says. "When
meeting for the first time, many people fill silences by talking about
themselves; turn the conversation around and ask them about their interests.
And once they’re talking, be engaged in what they have to say."<br />
<br />
</span><span class="subhead"><b>Tell A Compelling Story</b></span><span class="subhead"><br />
When Kurt Schneider, CEO of the Harlem Globetrotters, took over the lovable "clown
princes of basketball" in 2007, the team were a somewhat tired, nostalgic
property. In his quest to turn them into a multifaceted, modern entertainment
company, he first addressed the product’s narrative, says Brett Meister, senior
vice president of communications for Harlem Globetrotters.</span><span class="MsoHyperlink"></span> 
</p>
<p style="margin-left:0in;background:white;">
	"Rather
than a standard on-court game, he instilled the practice of writing and implementing
a new storyline each year; added drama and a big finish to each game; and he
mandated putting player nicknames on the jerseys," says Meister. "With
story elements that were easier to retain, the crowds grew, and the fans
started interacting with the brand."<span class="MsoHyperlink"></span> 
</p>
<p style="margin-left:0in;background:white;">
	Today
the team has more than a million fans on social media, they have the highest
merchandise sales in their history, and last year they set more than 50
attendance records, says Meister. "And every fan goes home with a dramatic
story to tell," he says.<br />
<br />
<span class="subhead"><b>Choose Colorful Language</b></span><br />
Avoid clichés and brainstorm a new way to get your message across, Lazarus told<em>Harvard Business
Review</em>. "Whereas other companies might say, ‘Politicians don’t
do well here,’ David [Ogilvy would say], ‘We abhor toadies.’ Other leaders
might tell their employees to respect the product’s end user; according to him,
‘The consumer isn’t a moron; she’s your wife.’"<span class="MsoHyperlink"></span> 
</p>
<h4 style="background:white;">
	ONLINE<span class="MsoHyperlink"></span> 
</h4>
<p style="margin-left:0in;background:white;">
	Most
people only meet a few hundred people a year in person, but the sky’s the limit
with social media, says Guy Kawasaki, chief evangelist of<span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>Canva,
an online graphic design tool. It’s important to make a great digital first
impression.<span class="MsoHyperlink"></span> 
</p>
<p style="margin-left:0in;background:white;">
	<span class="subhead"><b>Pick The Right Avatar<br />
A good avatar is your face. Period. "It’s not you and
your spouse, surfboard, Corvette, and dog," says Kawasaki. "It should
be front lit and asymmetrical. It should not be cropped out of a group photo
from last year’s Christmas party."</b></span><span class="MsoHyperlink"></span> 
</p>
<p style="margin-left:0in;background:white;">
	<span class="subhead"><b>Use A Cover Photo To Show Your Personality</b></span><span class="subhead"><br />
The purpose of your avatar is to convince people you are likable, trustworthy,
and competent, says Kawasaki; the purpose of your cover photo is to convince
you’re interesting. Use a photo that tells a story about your passions.</span><span class="MsoHyperlink"></span> 
</p>
<p style="margin-left:0in;background:white;">
	<span class="subhead"><b>Create Some Drama</b></span><span class="apple-converted-space"><b>&nbsp;</b></span><span class="subhead"><br />
Include a graphic or a video in everything you post. "Literally every
post," he says. "In a world dominated by plain text, posts with bling
attract more attention and make you more interesting."</span><span class="MsoHyperlink"></span>
